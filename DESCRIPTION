Description: Cross-Entropy optimisation of unconstrained deterministic and noisy
    functions through a highly flexible and customisable function which allows
    user to define custom variable domains, sampling distributions, updating
    and smoothing rules, and stopping criteria. Several built-in methods and
    settings makes the package very easy-to-use under standard optimisation
    problems.
