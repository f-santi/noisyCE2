## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* added references in the file DESCRIPTION
* added section "Value" to functions "smooth_lin" and "smooth_dec"
* substituted "\dontrun" with "\donttest" in the example of function noisyCE2
  since test takes more than 10s

All requested changes have been dealt with.



## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 3.6.0
* local ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS (Bionic Beaver), R 3.6.1
* win-builder (oldrelease, release, and devel)


## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs. 

Win-builder prompt 1 NOTE ONLY:

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  customisable (17:45)
